# Machine Learning in Production

Machine learning has transformed from a research field to a critical business capability. However, deploying ML models in production environments presents unique challenges that go beyond model accuracy.

## The Challenge of Production ML

Most data scientists focus on model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. While these metrics are important, production ML systems require additional considerations:

- **Scalability**: Models must handle varying loads
- **Reliability**: Systems need 99.9% uptime
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking
- **Data drift**: Models degrade over time as data changes

## Best Practices for ML Deployment

### 1. Model Versioning
Always version your models and maintain rollback capabilities. Use tools like MLflow or DVC for model tracking.

### 2. A/B Testing
Deploy new models gradually using A/B testing to compare performance against existing models.

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
Implement comprehensive monitoring for model performance, data quality, and system health.

## Conclusion

Production ML requires a shift in mindset from research to engineering. Success depends on robust infrastructure, monitoring, and operational practices.
